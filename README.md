# 🧠 Machine Learning From Scratch

This repository contains implementations of core Machine Learning algorithms **from scratch**, without relying on high-level ML libraries like scikit-learn. Each folder contains one algorithm, its dataset (if applicable), and Jupyter notebooks for step-by-step explanation and code.

## 🚧 Upcoming / In Progress

- [ ] Decision Trees
- [ ] Naive Bayes
- [ ] K-Means Clustering
- [ ] Neural Networks (Basic)

---

## 📌 Goals of This Repository
- Deepen understanding by implementing algorithms step-by-step
- Visualize how models work under the hood
- Create a growing ML reference from scratch
- Use minimal libraries (only `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)

---

## 📦 Environment
All notebooks are tested using:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- (Optional) Anaconda for environment management

---

## 🧩 Tips
- Each folder includes a `.ipynb` notebook with math, logic, and implementation.
- Check `.ipynb_checkpoints/` if you're resuming work or looking for autosaves.
- Some folders include datasets used for demonstration.
